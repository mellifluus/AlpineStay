# AlpineStay

This repository hosts all the history of my CODE challenge submission.

The website is meant to be viewed on a pc monitor, as I don't have the skill required to create a fully responsive web-page.

It's meant to give an idea of what this would look like as a finished product, while lacking many features.

Hope you enjoy!
